1.What is oops stands for?
    - OOPS stands for Object Oriented Programming 
    - It is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.

2.What is Polymorphism? explain types?
    -It refers to the ability of a class to provide different implementations of a method,
     depending on the type of object that is passed to the method.
    - Types of Polymorphism
           * Runtime polymorphism
                 - Method Overriding is an example of runtime polymorphism.
                 - When a subclass has same method as the parent class.
           * Compiletime Polymorphism
                 -Method Overloading is an example of compiletime polymorphism.
                 -When two or more methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters,
                   it is called as overloading. 
     
3.what is interface and example in selenium, java?
      -It is defined as an abstract type used to specify the behavior of a class.
      -It is a blueprint of a class.
      -Example
           *Java          -   AndriodDesign design=new SamsungPhone
           *Selenium  -  WebDriver driver=new ChromeDriver();  
         
4.what is abstarct class and example?
      -A class which is declared as abstract is known as abstract class.
      -It is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects, to access it, it must be inherited from another class.
      -It has unimplemented  and partially implemented methods
      -Example -  abstract class Bike  {     }

5.Difference between multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance
       -Multiple Inheritance
               * Multiple inheritance is an inheritance type where a class inherits from more than one base class.
               * It is not possible within the class level in java.
       -Multilevel Inheritance
               * Multilevel inheritance is an inheritance type that inherits from a derived class, a base class for a new class.
               * It is widely used in java.

6.Is multiple inheritance possible in java?
       - No, Multiple inheritance is not possible within the class level in java.
       - Because it creates ambuigity problem.

7.What is keyword for using inheritance  
       -extends keyword is used for inheritance.

8.what is the keyword to connect interface and class
       -implements keyword is used to connect interface and class.

9.what is difference between class and interface
       -Class
              *Class can instantiate variable and create object
              *Class can contain concrete methods
              *The access modifiers used with classes are private, protected and public.
       -Interface
              * Interface can't instantiate variable and create an object.
              *Interface can't contain concrete methods
              *In interface only public modifier is used.

10.what is difference between class and abstract class
        -Class
              *A concrete class is not declared using abstract modifier.
              *It cannot contain abstract method.
              *It can be declared as final.
        -Abstract Class
              *An Abstract class is declared using abstract modifier.
              *It may or may not contains abstract method.
              *It cannot be declared as final.
