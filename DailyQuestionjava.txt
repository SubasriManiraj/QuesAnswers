
1.Explain about the main method in java?
     -pubic static void main(String[] args)
        *public---- It is access modifier
        *static ---- Keyword,the main method has to static so that JVM can load the class into memory and call the main method
        *void   ---- Java main method doesn't return anything, that's why it's return type is void.
        *main  ----It is called by JVM to execute the program line by line and end the execution after the completion of this method
        *String[] args---- It is used to hold the command line arguments in the form of string values.
 
2.What are the different  Control flow Statements available in java?
     -Control flow statements
           *Decision making statements
                   -if..else
                   -Switch..case
           *Looping statements
                   -while loop
                   -for loop
                   -do.. while loop
           *Jump statements
                   -break
                   -continue

3.What is the Difference betweeen break and continue statements?
     - Break Statements
            * The Break Statement is used to terminate the loop immediately.
            *break keyword is used to indicate break statements in java programming.
     -Continue Statements
            *The continue Statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop.
            *continue keyword is used to indicate continue statement in java programming.

4.What is an Array? How will you declare an array in java?
      -Array
           *  Array ia a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.
           * The length of an array is established when the array is created.
           * After creation, its length is fixed.
      -To declare array
           *To create an array, define the data type (like int) and specify the name of the array followed by square brackets[].
           *To insert values to it, use a comma seperated list, inside curly braces.
           *Example : int myNumbers[]={9,19, 29, 39};

5.When will you get ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException?
       - The ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception is thrown if a program tries to access an array index that is negative, greater than, or equal to the length of an array.
       - The ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception is a run-time exception.

6.Define the Syntax to create an object for a class.
       -When we create an instance of the class by using the new keyword,
       - it allocates memory (heap) for the newly created object and also returns the reference of that object to that memory.
       -The new keyword is also used to create an array. 
       -The syntax for creating an object is: ClassName object = new ClassName();

What are the naming conventions to be followed while creating a class, 
method and a variable.Explain with examoles
      -Java follows camel-case syntax for naming the class, interface, method, and variable.
      -If the name is combined with two words, the second word will start with uppercase letter.
      - Example- actionPerformed(), firstName, ActionEvent, ActionListener, etc.

7.What is Variable?How will you declare a variables in java?
       -Variable
            *Variable in Java is a data container that saves the data values during Java program execution. 
            *Every variable is assigned a data type that designates the type and quantity of value it can hold. 
            *A variable is a memory location name for the data.
       -Declare a variable
            *type variableName = value; Where type is one of Java's types (such as int or String ),
            *variableName is the name of the variable (such as x or name). 
            *The equal sign is used to assign values to the variable.

8.What is String in java? Is it a Data Type?
        -String
              *Strings are a sequence of characters. 
              *In the Java programming language, strings are objects. 
              *The Java platform provides the String class to create and manipulate strings.
              *Yes. String is a non primitive data types.

9.What are the different ways to create the String Object in java?
         -There are two ways to create a String object:
               *By string literal : Java String literal is created by using double quotes. For Example: String s=“Welcome”;
               *By new keyword : Java String is created by using a keyword “new”. For example: String s=new String(“Welcome”);

10.What is the Difference between .Equals and ==? 
         -.Equals
               *.Equal is a method.
               *The equals() method tests whether two variables refer to objects that have the same state (values).
         -==
               *== is an operator.
               *The == operator tests whether two variables have the same references (aka pointer to a memory address).
